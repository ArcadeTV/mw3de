BIG SPOILERS AHEAD!

This is all the text ripped from Wonder Boy, it had to be reformatted and
uncompressed. Everything from enemy names, item names, signs and speech dialog
is included.

The only readable things that are not included are stored in picture-form
such as the title screen. Also any weird symbols you see is Japanese text
which was not translated because it did not make the final release of the
game.

The structure is roughly from the start of the game to the ending, but I left
some comments in brackets if you want to find certain things.

Press CTRL+F and enter the code to jump that section.

FAQ.

  1. What are those weird letters under the inventory list?
     They are unused key items in the game which haven't been translated to
     english. Their translation is rapidpad and rod, they do nothing if you use
     a cheat cartridge to acquire them.

  2. I do not recognise some of the text here, where can I find it?
     Some text can only be read by trying to skip levels and do thing you are
     not suppose to. So when you are allowed to access certain parts of the
     game, you can no longer find this text. There does not appear to be any
     text which can't be accesed at some point in the game.

  3. What text is in picture form that is not included in this dump?
     Just the load up screen and main title screen, and ending screen which
     includes:

Monster World was
once a peaceful
region.

Then, the peace was
shattered by an
invading army of
monsters.

A young man named
Shion vowed to
defeat them and
make his land
peaceful again.

Having difficulties
already? Give it
another try!

Welcome to Monster
World! Once again
this world is being
threatened.

The princess has
been kidnapped from
Purapril Castle.

You'd better use
caution.

Here's an Elixer
and Firestorm. Take
them with you.

Make sure you're
ready to use magic
at all times! What
are you waiting
for? Get moving!

Alsedo, the fairy
village

Purapril Castle
Entrance

Maugham Desert-
enter at your own
risk!

Lilypad, the
dwarf village

Begonia, the dragon
village

Childam,
the Darkworld village

Purapril, the Aqua
Capital

Welcome to Purapril
Castle.

Stay as long as you
like.

This is Purapril
Castle!

Entry is prohibited.

Go away!

I hear that peace has returned to Alsedo.
It appears that the village of Alsedo is being attacked. 

I just told you
that no one may
enter the castle.

Did I speak too
fast for you?

Looks like we're sold out of everything. Come on back some other time. 
Welcome to Bacchus, a store with a reputation for good service. We have great confidence in the products we sell. 
Use this item wisely! 
Oh, I'm terribly
sorry.

We seem to be out
of stock on that
item.

Welcome to Kishera.

Stand in front of
the item you wish
to purchase and
look up. Thank you
very much.

Hmmm... I'm out of
stock on that right
now.

Try back later.

Welcome to
Felissimo.

We have a medicine
for sale.

Use medicines with
care.

I'm Sonia.

The village is
under attack.

I don't know all
the details, so
you'd better see
Eleanora.

If you stand
between the statues
and look up, you
can find her.

I'm Queen Eleanora.

The monsters come
from a cave just
beyond the village.

Can't you help us?

Take Priscilla with
you.

She may be able to
help you.

Remember, though,
that once you set
foot outside
Alsedo, Priscilla
will return to me,
as she won't be
able to help you
any more. Is
Priscilla helping
you? 

You need the
Ocarina to open the
cave doors, but I
lost it somewhere
inside the cave.

Keep in mind that
when you equip a
spear, you can't
use a shield.

Remember this when
selecting a weapon.
Queen Eleanora is a
wonderful person,
isn't she? Queen
Eleanora was
calling for you
earlier.

Why don't you pay
her a visit?

If it's the cave up
ahead that you wish
to know about, go
ask Sonia. Our
village is free! We
are all very
grateful.

Good morning. Did
you sleep well?

Good luck to you on
your journey.

That was close.

You shouldn't take
chances like that!

Please be more
careful!

Oh, it's the
Ocarina!

You went there to
look for it, didn't
you?

The melody of the
Ocarina may help to
break the seals.

Let's practice.
Think you've got it?

Play these melodies
whenever you're in
the cave.

You've forgotten
the melodies already?

You're realy
hopeless, you know?

Let's practice them
again. Have you got
it now?

If you forget them
again, come on back
and I'll help you
out.

Thanks to you, the
village is saved.

Keep the Ocarina.

It might come in
handy.

Did the Ocarina
prove useful?

Thank you so much.

Alsedo is once more
a peaceful village.

Go beyond the large
tree and you'll
reach Purapril.

If you're ever in
need of help of any
kind, come and see
me.

I'm forever in your
debt. How's your
journey going?

There are still a
great many people
in need of your help.

Go now and do
everything in your
power to save them!

Oh oh, looks like
everything's gone.

Come around again
sometime.

Buy something, will
you?

If you don't, I'll
start breathing fire!

Oh, thank you.

You're rolling in
dough,aren't you?

What? I've got
nothing to sell!

I guess the shop is
closed now...

Find anything you
like?

I would create a sword from the Old Axe, but a necessary item to do so has been stolen from me. With the Fire-Urn, I can create a sword from the Old Axe. It will take some time. 
The Elder Dragon was calling for you a while ago so why don't you go and see him? 
It's not ready yet. Please wait just a little longer. It's finished! Here you go. Use its legendary powers and save Monster World for us! 

One of the children of my village has been kidnapped. I don't want to see anyone. Do me a favor and just go away. 
Please... You're the one who saved the child? I am eternally grateful to you. 
You're a hero. Now you should meet Poseidon. He is in a perpetual sleep at the bottom of the sea. In order to swim underwater, you need Poseidon's Trident. Unfortunately, the monsters have gotten their claws on it... 
You found the Trident! Now you're able to swim underwater. Go find Poseidon! 


Looks like I'm a storekeeper with nothing to sell! HA, HA, HA, HA... 
Welcome to Gooningle's. I may not have the best shop in the land, but there's not a friendlier store keeper around! 
Now that's a fine piece, isn't it?


I'm terribly sorry, but I seem to be out of stock. 
Welcome to Drapnell sundry goods. 
Thank you. Be sure to use magic carefully. 


Rise and shine! 
You're wasting precious daylight! 
Get enough rest? Good! Good luck to you! 
Boy, that was a close call. Better keep your eyes open. 


At last you've come. I knew you would appear before too long. Now, you must search for the Old Axe hidden in Ice World. To get to Ice World, you'll need this special Bracelet. 
Shion takes the Bracelet. 
I already gave you the Bracelet. 
So, you've managed to get your hands on the Old Axe. The Blacksmith will give you all the details. 
This boy is my grandson. Take him with you, for I belive he can be of some help. You must hurry. Find the Old Axe and then return to me. 
The deciding battle is now at hand. After receiving the Legendary Sword from the Blacksmith, go to the Bell Tower at Purapril Castle and point the sword toward the sky. 
Emerge victorious and return safely! We're counting on you! 


I'm terribly sorry, but I seem to be out of stock. 
Welcome to Sundry. See anything you like? 
The Charmstone is... wait a minute! I'm not going to tell you that! 

It's been years
since we last had a
visitor.

Your journey has
just begun. Please
take care.

The jellyfish will
help you on your way.


Maugham Desert is a forbidding place. 
It is said that one who wears the Oasis Boots can cross the desert. 
It looks like the store over there is open. 


I know of a dwarf village deep in the woods that lie ahead. I believe it's called Lilypad. 
The well at Purapril Castle is connected to the sea by an underground waterway. 
It's only a rumor, but I've heard of a house that's hidden somewhere in town. 


My younger brother, Hotta, has been taken by the monsters. What am I going to do? The monsters have a den just beyond the village. Could they be holding Hotta there? 
You're the one who saved my brother! He wants to go with you. You know, he just may be able to help you. Don't go too far, though... 
My brother seems to have grown very fond of you. Please take him out again sometime. 
Thank you again for your help. Has my brother been able to help you at all? He's very good at finding hidden rooms, you know. 


You've done well to find this place, but I'm afraid I don't speak to anyone not holding a Charmstone. 
How about trading your Charmstone for this Heart? 
Oh, you will trade. How about that! Come back anytime, friend. 
No deal, eh? Well, come on back some other time. 
Oh, sorry. Your Heart supply can't get any larger. 
If you have two Charmstones, I can increase your magical powers. 
How about trading me those two Charmstones for some new magic? 
Oh, you will trade! Great! Come on by anytime you're in the area. 
Oh, well. Can't win'em all. Hope to see you again. 
Oh, my mistake. You can't handle any more magic. Sorry about that.  


The Myconid!

It looks like the store is closed. 


Sold out? I'm not surprised. 
Guess it's time to head out and collect some more weapons. 
Hey, come on in and help us celebrate the Grand Opening of our shop. 
This is Wanderer, the finest weapon shop in the land. 
Back again, eh? 
Nothing but the best for my customers. 
I've collected these items on my many journeys.  


It's locked. 

I had been taken prisoner by the monsters. Please come to the castle hall. I'd like to thank you. 

The gate to the castle has been opened. Why don't you go on inside? 

If you have the Amulet, you can find the shrine at the bottom of the sea. 
Let me have your Ocarina and I'll tell you where to find the Amulet. What do you say? 
There's a door hidden amidst four palm trees. From there you should be able to find the Amulet. 
Oh, that's too bad. If you need my help, drop by again. 
Did you forget what I told you? OK. Find four palm trees, then find the door that's hidden amidst them. Good luck. 
If you have the Amulet, the shrine will appear right before your eyes. 
So you're the legendary hero! Now maybe my father will be able to get a decent night's sleep. 
I'm the daughter of Poseidon. 


You're here at last. The legendary hero. The Elder Dragon is waiting for you. Before you meet him, though, visit the Sphinx to increase your strength. There's a Pyramid just beyond the Maugham Desert. 
An item that will help you cross the desert is hidden somewhere in this shrine. Find it and then go see the Sphinx. 
What are you dilly- dallying about for? Many people await your help. 
I'm going back to sleep. 
He's already in a deep sleep. 


The princess has returned safely. I'm so relieved. 
The princess is waiting. 
Make yourself at home. 


The door has been sealed. 

So you've
arrived. As you may
have guessed, I'm
the Sphinx. I've
got this thing for
quizzes, but then
you've probably
heard that by now.
Tell you what I'm
gonna do. I'm gonna
ask you some
questions - 5, to
be exact. When
you've answered
them all correctly,
I'm gonna send you
into a new world.
Are you ready?
Here's the first
question. Here's
the second
question. Here's
the third question.
Here's the fourth
question. Here's
the final question.
This is terrible.
You missed every
one!. Looks like
the end of the line
for you... 

How sad.
You only got one
right. I can't let
you pass... 

This is
no good. You only
got two correct.
Come back and try
again. 

Not bad, but
not good enough.
You got 3 right.
Try the quiz one
more time. You're
so close. 

You only
missed one! I'll
let you pass!
That's fantastic!
You got every one
right! As your
reward, I bestow
upon you Thunder
Magic. You may pass.


The Elder Dragon has something he wishes to discuss with you. Please go to him now. 
Only one bearing the Ancient Axe can enter the volcano. 
I saw someone carring the Fire- Urn and preparing to enter the volcano.  

The shop is closed.

I'm Shiela Purapril.

I thank you for
rescuing me.

I heard that you're
on a journey and
that you're
battling the
monsters.

Why don't you stop
by the village of
Lilypad?

There may be
something there for
you.

Watch out for
monsters on your way.

I Thank you again.

Are you having a
safe journey?

Rumor has it that
you're the
legendary hero. Is
it true that you
crossed the
desert? That's
incredible! I heard
you went to Ice
Castle.

Be very, very
careful.

I worry about you.

The Sphinx! 

The Bracelet has begun to glow. The seal is broken. 


Forgive me, but we seem to be sold out. Please come again. 
Thank you for coming. This is the weapon shop known as Labyrinth. 
Thank you very much. What an excellent choice! 


It looks like I'm a storekeeper with nothing to sell! Ha, ha, ha, ha... Well, come on in. Take your time. 


You're the legendary hero I've heard so much about. 
The item you're looking for is in Ice Castle. Be warned-it's a frightening place. 
Take Shabo with you, in case you need help. The Old Axe, in its original form, is of no use to you. 
You'd better return to Begonia and see the Blacksmith. 
You're finally starting to look like a hero. 
It appears that my job is done. Now, your final battle will no doubt be fierce, but I'm confident that you'll triumph and that will be allowed to return to our land.  



To enter the volcano, you must enter the room on the other side of this door, but in order to enter, you must have the following items: the Pygmy Sword, Pygmy Armor, Pygmy Shield, and Pygmy Boots. 
You have satisfied the requirements. You may enter. 
One of the items is missing. Continue your search. 
You need two more items. Continue your search. 
You have only one of the four you need. Continue your search. 
You have yet to find even one of the items. You must find all four.  


Gragg & Glagg! 

The Ice Bomber! 

The Tyrant Dragon! 

The Almighty Demon King!

I've heard that the
Sphinx in the
Pyramid likes
quizzes. 

If you have a certain special item, you can swim underwater.  

The star crest on this Bell Tower is the same as the insignia on the weapon of the legendary hero. The princess told me this a long time ago. 


You're very strong. 
I hope one day I'll be so strong. 
It is said that there's a shrine at the bottom of the sea, but no one's ever been able to find the entrance. 


I am the Prince of DarkWorld, and you must be the legendary hero. 
I was under the control of Biomeka, a deadly creature from outer space, but I'm alright now. 
Thank you for coming to my aid.... 


Some hero. Is that the best you can do?
Well, watch this!


Not too bad, eh? Now, let's see if you've got what it takes. 



You're really going to go,aren't you... Can't you stay with me? No, you're the legendary hero. You must go. Be sure to come back safely. I'll be waiting right here for you. 


There's a convenient slot.... 
Shion inserts the Gold Gem. 
The Gem doesn't fit! 

Shion inserts the
Blue Gem.

A secret lies in the surface of the walls of Ice Castle.

Do you know where the prince went? I think he's gone to Nightmare Castle. He's probably attempting to collect the legendary weapons. It looks as though he's got all but one of them...  

It's sealed. 

You can ride a jellyfish!


The monsters have
come and made this
their home, so no
one may enter!


Finally, the long, treacherous journey has reached its end. 


None of the people in Monster World will ever forget what they've been through, nor will they forget the hero who gave their lives back to them. 


The story of Shion's valiant struggle will no doubt be passed on from generation to generation. 


And so ends another episode in the adventures of "Wonder Boy". 


Welcome home, Shion. I'm so happy you made it back safely. I don't think I'll ever forget you... ever. 

The dwarf child is in danger!

Danger! The desert lies ahead!

Anyone shorter than this sign will not be able to move it.
